# KaspaFlow ⚡

> **Money that flows like water.**  
> Real-time streaming payments powered by Kaspa's 10 BPS BlockDAG.

## 🏆 Project Overview

**KaspaFlow** introduces a new paradigm for payments on Proof-of-Work blockchains: **continuous money streaming**. Instead of discrete, lump-sum transactions, users can stream KAS to recipients by the second.

Whether it's **payroll**, **subscriptions**, or **live tipping**, KaspaFlow leverages Kaspa's high throughput (10 blocks per second) and sub-second confirmation times to make money feel fluid.

### Key Features
- **💸 Continuous Streams**: Define a total amount and duration, and the system handles micro-transactions automatically.
- **⚡ Real-Time Visualization**: Animated particles represent actual KAS flowing between wallets.
- **📊 Live Dashboard**: Watch balance updates, transaction confirmations, and flow rates in real-time.
- **🎮 Demo Mode**: Try the full experience without a wallet using simulated data.
- **🔗 Kasware Integration**: Connects directly with the leading Kaspa browser wallet.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- [Kasware Wallet](https://kasware.xyz) (Browser Extension)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KaspaFlow.git
   cd KaspaFlow
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Custom Design System)
- **Blockchain**: Kaspa (Testnet 10)
- **Wallet**: Kasware Wallet API
- **RPC/API**: Kaspa REST API (`api-tn10.kaspa.org`)
- **Animation**: HTML5 Canvas + requestAnimationFrame

## 🏗️ Architecture

KaspaFlow consists of three main layers:

1. **Stream Engine (`lib/stream/engine.ts`)**
   - Handles the scheduling of micro-transactions based on flow rate.
   - Manages state (active, paused, completed) and persistence via `localStorage`.
   - Supports both real on-chain execution and demo simulation.

2. **Wallet Integration (`lib/kaspa/wallet.ts`)**
   - Wraps the `window.kasware` API for connection and signing.
   - Listens for account and balance changes.
   - Falls back to `Demo Mode` for judges without the extension.

3. **Visualization Layer (`components/dashboard/*`)**
   - **ParticleFlow**: Canvas-based animation where speed/density = flow rate.
   - **TxTicker**: Real-time feed of confirmed transaction hashes.
   - **StatsCounter**: Smoothly animated counters for global stats.

## 🤖 AI Usage Disclosure

This project was built with the assistance of **Google DeepMind's Antigravity agent**.

- **Ideation**: AI helped analyze existing hackathon projects to identify the "streaming payments" gap.
- **Code Generation**: AI assisted in scaffolding the Next.js app, generating the particle animation logic, and writing boilerplate for the Kasware API wrapper.
- **Design**: The glassmorphism UI system and CSS variables were generated by AI based on prompt specifications.

**Human verification**: All blockchain integration logic, flow rate calculations, and wallet interactions were manually verified and tested on the Kaspa testnet.
